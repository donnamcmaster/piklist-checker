Class Piklist_Checker 

This class file is intended for use by WordPress plugins that rely on the Piklist plugin, in order to verify that Piklist is installed and activated. 

Piklist is no longer supported and the official repo is closed (read-only). This class file has an error that originally only generated a warning but it is now fatal. So I downloaded the source from https://github.com/piklist/piklist/blob/b71d6d5ce73cdd22b96b6642d18588e9fc88e967/.wordpress-org/class-piklist-checker.php and am updating it with a fix.
